# Architecture of P[Ψ]:-

The letter psi is commonly used in physics to represent wave functions in quantum mechanics, such as in the Schrödinger equation and bra–ket notation: {<Φ/Ψ>}. It is also used to represent the (generalized) positional states of a qubit in a quantum computer.
Similarly, I am using <b>Ψ</b> to notify or present the P<sup>®</sup>: A New Generation Programming Language for 128-bit Architecture, and it's a people friendly programming public language.

- <b>Ψ.actional(){}[]</b>;
  - Ψ.additional(){};
  - Ψ.conditional(){};
  - Ψ.traditional(){};
  - Ψ.functional(){};
  
## How to write or Syntax, please go through it.
  - <b>Ψ</b>.fn(){};
  - <b>Ψ</b>.fn($a,$b,$c,$d){};
